# supabase_learn

For learning purpose opened up supabase and started integrating it in flutter

## Getting Started
A simple application in which you can find Database page using CRUD operations with People table on supabase. 
You can store names of people in it. Added a simple FAB for adding users and a dismissable to delete.

A realtime page in which we get real-time update from supbase table Quotes.
A Fab is added which gets a random anime quote and sends it to supabase and a StreamBuilder beautifully prints it on screen.
You can delete by dismissing it as well.
